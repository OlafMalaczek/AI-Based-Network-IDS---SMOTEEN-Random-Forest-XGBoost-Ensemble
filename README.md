# AI-Based-Network-IDS---SMOTEEN-Random-Forest-XGBoost-Ensemble
Welcome to this cohesive repository of an Network Intrusion Detection System. This AI NIDS uses SMOTEENN, Random Forest, and XGBoost in a soft-voting ensemble. It detects DDoS, PortScan, and WebAttacks, handling imbalanced data, and provides per-class ROC/PR curves, confusion matrices, feature importances, and metrics like balanced accuracy and MCC

#Introduction
As cyber threats continue to grow in sophistication, effective network security has become essential. Conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often fall short in identifying complex and evolving attacks. AI-NIDS tackles this challenge by combining Machine Learning techniques, including SMOTEENN, Random Forest, XGBoost, and a soft-voting ensemble, to accurately detect and classify network intrusions.

This system is trained on real-world datasets covering DDoS, PortScan, and WebAttack traffic. By addressing class imbalances and leveraging ensemble learning, AI-NIDS can reliably identify both known and emerging threats, providing a scalable and adaptive solution for modern network security.
